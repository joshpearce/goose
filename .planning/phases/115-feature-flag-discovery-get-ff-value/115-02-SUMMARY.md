# Phase 115 Plan 02: Debug UI Display Summary

One-liner: Feature flags hex-pair row added to Runtime section in About tab, reading from `connectedCapabilities.featureFlags` with empty-state fallback.

## What Was Built

Added a `MoreInfoRow(title: "Feature Flags", ...)` to the existing Runtime section of `MoreAboutView` in `GooseSwift/MoreInfoViews.swift`.

- When `connectedCapabilities?.featureFlags` is nil or empty: shows `"None discovered"` with `.pending` status badge.
- When flags are present: shows comma-separated `"0x%02X → 0x%02X"` pairs sorted ascending by key index, with `.ready` status badge.
- A private `featureFlagsSummary` computed property encapsulates the formatting, mirroring the existing `appVersion` property.
- No new bridge call in the view — the value is read directly from `model.ble.connectedCapabilities`, which is populated by the GET_FF_VALUE flow implemented in 115-01.

## Tasks

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Add Feature Flags row to Runtime section | ecaa958 | GooseSwift/MoreInfoViews.swift |
| 2 | Checkpoint: Visual verify | — | (awaiting human) |

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

## Threat Flags

None. The Feature Flags row is a read-only display of already-validated, in-memory data. No new untrusted input is introduced (T-115-04 accepted per plan threat model).

## Known Stubs

None. The row reads live data from `connectedCapabilities` — no placeholder values.

## Self-Check

- [x] `GooseSwift/MoreInfoViews.swift` modified — Feature Flags row and `featureFlagsSummary` property present
- [x] Commit ecaa958 exists: `feat(115-02): add Feature Flags row to Runtime section in About view`
- [x] Build: `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **` (iPhone 17 Pro simulator, UDID 95142C9B)
- [ ] Human checkpoint: visual verification pending
